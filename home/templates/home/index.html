      Schr√∂dinger is thrilled to return with our second annual hackathon in support of the diverse community of women and non-binary engineers. During the hackathon you will work on a team to design and build a modern web application that will help chemists and materials scientists process large quantities of data to identify the best compounds for their needs.

      This demo was built using a starter template for a Django project that is available for you and your team to use during the hackathon. The template project comes pre-configured with some boilerplate code that will allow you to hit the ground running when you get started with your application. You can find the source code for the template and this demo on the Schrodinger GitHub account:
